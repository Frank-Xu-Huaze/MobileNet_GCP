# MobileNet_GCP

#### An app using MobileNet to do Object Identification within the ImageNet dataset (1000 objects).

1. The app.yaml for gcp deploy. You can play with instance type inside to deploy a different type of instance. Beware of the fees of advance instances.

2. The main.py as the python file to deploy the app. You can play with it locally by running "python main.py" to deploy it locally.

3. The requirements.txt that contains all the packages for the app. Make sure you run "pip install -r requirements.txt" before deploying app or notebook locally.

4. The notebook file that includes simple code that shows how to make predictions using a local file. It is essentially the app but without all the html stuff.
